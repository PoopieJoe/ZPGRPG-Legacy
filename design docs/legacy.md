Main design document to provide the vision for the game

# Global view
Legacy is a semi-simulation game wherin the main character (MC) drives itself to attain godhood though fame and power by completing quests, building relationships with characters, and moving up the social ladder. 

How the MC will accomplish this, is up to 3 things:  
1. The player's directions  
   The player can direct the MC through various actions:  
    1. Allocating level-up points  
       Upon level-up, the player determines which skill the MC improves with. this results in the MC becoming more proficiÃ«nt with those skills, letting them use them more. This in turn will make the MC prefer aspects associated with those skills.  
    2. Prioritizing tasks  
       By giving priority to particular tasks exposes the MC to particular activites, characters and circumstances, influencing their preferences
    3. Giving direct commands
       The player can give simple direct commands to go to places, use/buy/collect items, providing goals, etc.
   
2. The MC's preference
   The MC has a certain personal profile that lets them prefer certain tasks, lets then enjoy certain activities, and lets them form complex opinions of other people.    
   Things that influence preference:  
   1. Exposure
   2. Availability

3. What the environment provides  
   The place and situation the MC is in provides certain resources, tasks, and characters to interact with. The MC will do its best to make the most of its situation, but if it cannot provide sufficient preferences of the MC they will attempt to move somewhere they know can provide them, try to find another place, or try to convert their current environment.
