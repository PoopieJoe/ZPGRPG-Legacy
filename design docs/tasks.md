# Tasks

There are several ways tasks can be added to the MC's task list:

1. Quests  
This is the most intuitive way. Quests are a series of tasks that will result in the MC gaining experience, money, fame, power, relationships, or any combination of those things.

2. Maintanance  
Repairing equipment, keeping up relations and appearances.

3. Upgrades
Improvements on equipment as the characters power level grows.

4. Health
Treating conditions

# Priorities
Tasks are prioritized from 0 (critical) positive infinity (don't care when completed). For example, tasks relating to life-threatening health conditions have critical priority.   
Tasks are added to the list, which is then sorted according to how much the character desires to see them resolved, based of several factors:  
1. Duty  
   Tasks that have to be done to complete the overarching purpose of attaining godhood. And staying alive.
2. Convenience  
   Tasks that can easily be completed quickly and without risk are preferred more.
3. Values  
   Tasks that align with the MC's values are preferred more
